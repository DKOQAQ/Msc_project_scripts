# Msc_project_scripts
LTspice scripts used in the project

The file contains three sub-files 
###
no_parasiticcapacitance contains four model scripts without parasitic capacitance, the dispersion curve could also be plotted from these scripts. All the codes needed to plot the S-parameters and the dispersion curve are included in the command.
#
Notice:
The result of the dispersion relation is in dB, which needs to be changed to linear.
####
fix&random_parasiticcapacitance contains four model scripts with parasitic capacitance,
